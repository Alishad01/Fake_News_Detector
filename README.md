# 📰 Fake News Generator & Detector using Generative AI and NLP

This project showcases the **power and responsibility** of Generative AI. It demonstrates how large language models like **GPT-2** can be used to **generate fake news headlines**, and how transformer-based models like **BERT** can be trained to **detect fake vs real headlines**.
